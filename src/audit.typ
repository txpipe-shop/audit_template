=== Audited Files
#v(1em)

Below is a list of all audited files in this report.
Any files *not* listed here were *not* audited.
The final state of the files for the purposes of this report is considered to be commit `XXXX`.
// i.e., this is the commit hash resulting from all resolutions, if any.

= Specification

== UTxOs

// - Use singular "UTxO" for singletons: UTxO types that are designed to have
//   only one instance sitting at an address.
//   Example: "Protocol Settings UTxO"
// - Use plural "UTxOs" for UTxO types that are designed to have multiple
//   instances.
//   Example: "Order UTxOs"

=== Example UTxO/s

_Briefly explain here the purpose of the UTxO/s._

- Address:
  - Parameters: ...
- Value:
  - ADA:
  - Asset A: _(policy and token name)_
  - ...
- Datum: _(datum type and fields)_

== Transactions

The purpose of the transaction diagrams that follow is to outline the key
aspects of each operation in the protocol.
To provide a clearer presentation, we omit details such as the minimum ADA
required in each UTxO, transaction fees, the sources of that ADA, etc.

=== Example transaction

_Briefly explain here the purpose of the transaction._
_You can use @XXX-001 to reference findings_

See @fig:example for an example transaction diagram.
